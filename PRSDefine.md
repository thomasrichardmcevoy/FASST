# Problem Solving Skills

## Capability and Deficits
Different problem solving strategies can improve the creation and application of security policy, procedures and technology.  Security is often compliance driven, whereas
a goal driven security approach can lead to creative solutions.  An example of a problem solving framework is Cynefin.

Security tends to become overexpensive or even useless where tradition or compliance is substituted for actual problem solving.  A good example are failures in password
policy where the passwords created were neither memorable, unguessable or uncomputable.

## Recommended Countermeasures
Security traditions and compliance based solutions should be challenged on a regular basis.  Updating skills and knowledge and keeping an eye on technical trends is one
of the easiest ways of doing this.
