# Problem Solving Skills

## Capability and Deficits
Different problem solving strategies can improve the creation and application of security policy, procedures and technology.  Security is often compliance driven, whereas
a goal driven security approach can lead to creative solutions.  An example of a problem solving framework is Cynefin.

Security tends to become overexpensive or even useless where tradition or compliance is substituted for actual problem solving.  A good example are failures in password
policy where the passwords created were neither memorable, unguessable or uncomputable.

## Recommended Countermeasures
Security traditions and compliance based solutions should be challenged on a regular basis.  Updating skills and knowledge and keeping an eye on technical trends is one
of the easiest ways of doing this. Tackling cybersecurity problems with different viewpoints and problem solving strategies enables experts to get ahead of the attacker.
