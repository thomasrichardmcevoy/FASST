# Functional Testing

## Capability and Deficits
Functional testing ensures that security technology operates in an assured fashion.  This is particularly important for encryption and detection devices and formal tests should 
be run to ensure their planned configuration operates correctly under environmental conditions.  Funcitional testing also includes testing during software development - see [SDL](https://github.com/thomasrichardmcevoy/FASST/blob/master/SDLDefine.md).

Failure to test can lead to functional errors such as inadequate encryption set up or failure of security mechanisms to operate correctly, exposing the organization.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Institute functional testing as part of the design and build process.
