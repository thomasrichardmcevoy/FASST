# Ethical Commitment

## Capability and Deficits
An ethical commitment is an internal commitment to "do the right thing".  So, in cyber security terms, it is a commitment to following the policy and guidance laid out and to 
seeking advice on cybersecurity issues from experts where required.  It also requires a level of emotional engagement in the organization and its values, even simply at team
level.

A lack of ethical commitment does not necessarily lead to malicious acts but it can and does lead to carelessness with regards to cybersecurity practice and diminishing its
importance to the job and to the workplace.

## Recommended Countermeasures
Ethical commitment comes partly from hiring workers who are ethical in their dealings so e.g. looking for evidence of non-criminality.  To some extent, it can be inculcated in
security awareness training  by providing knowledge of right actions and scenarios or role plays giving examples of these.  Social influence is also an important part of
ethics, because even though it is an inner value, it is partly enforced by the actions and attitudes of others.  Treating staff ethically and justly and demonstrating care
for them on a human level also increases loyalty and commitment which underpins ethical decision-making.  Workplace design plays a factor in underpinning ethics and engagement.
