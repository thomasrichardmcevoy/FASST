# Work Design Participation

## Capability and Deficits
Users should participate in the design of their own workplace, including its security technology and processes.

Failure to instigate participation by users in work design is likely to result in poor design and users attempting workarounds which may undermine security.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Users should participate in work design and use should be made of agile methodologies to ensure that any processes or technology are piloted and subjected to testing in
live operations - with contingency to roll back designs which do not work or cause unexpected side effects on work or security processes.
