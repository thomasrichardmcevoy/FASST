# Denial of Service Prevention

## Capability and Deficits
A denial of service attack is a set of messages which are designed to take down an organization's internet boundary and render it incapable of communicating externally.  
The attack works either by crafting messages to cause network boundary device failures or application failures or else by using the sheer volume of messages to
overcome system capabilities.

Failure to have some form of defense or contingency in place to deal with denial of service attacks can render an organization effectively out of business during the duration
of the attack.

## Recommended Countermeasures
Various countermeasures can be employed depending on the organization.  Third parties specialising in denial of service defense can work on behalf of the organization.  High
quality network boundary protections can be used to deal with attacks or the organization can distribute its network access or business access difficult to attack e.g. selling
through third parties.
