# Return on Investment

## Capability and Deficits
Measuring return on investment is considered to be difficult in cybersecurity, primarily due to a rejection of quantitative risk management methodologies.  But  where they are
adopted, assumptions can be made about the effectiveness of controls in reducing risk, which while they represent estimates, give a better picture of return on investment than
other methods.

Failure to find a method for determining ROI means that security spend is just seen as overhead and progress does not seem to be measured in a satisfactory manner.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Use a quantitative risk analysis method such as FAIR and adopt metrics which allow the organization to determine what progress has been made on implementing and operating
security controls
