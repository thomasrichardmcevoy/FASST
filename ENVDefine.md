# Environment

## Capability and Deficits

The work environment, either organizationally or even physically, can support or undermine carrying out security tasks.  Examples include creating secure remote access,
providing electronic wallets to staff to store multiple passwords, ensuring that security features work in the physical work environment (e.g. on a factory floor or
oil rig) as expected.

Failure to take into account the environment and work organization when designing security functionality can lead to failures.  For example, a biometric handprint reader in
an engine room failed due to oil dirtying hands.  Another example is expecting police officers to remember multiple complex passwords but never be allowed to write them down or
store them, especially where such systems have to be used during incidents.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Take account of the work environment and work organization during design of security procedures and functionality.
