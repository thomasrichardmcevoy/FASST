# Environment

## Capability and Deficits

The work environment is taken into account in carrying out security tasks. For example, physical features of the environment such as dirt, cold, or damp can interfere with 
security functionality

Failure to take into account the environment  when designing security functionality can lead to failures.  For example, a biometric handprint reader in
an engine room failed due to oil dirtying hands.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Take account of the work environment and work organization during design of security procedures and functionality.
