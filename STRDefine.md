# Strategy

## Capability and Deficits

Strategy is the capability for long term planning and direction in terms of both organizational structure and technology stack.  Given the fast moving past of technology 
and the changing threat landscape, it is important to ensure that the cybersecurity strategy blends with the overall organizational and IT strategy and also
creates resilience in the face of threats.

Failure to set a strategy for cybersecurity leads to tactical choices being driven by inconsistent considerations - such as threat "immediacy" or the halo of "new technology" 
rather than a considered response, based on long term planning and risk management.  This can result in a lack of integration in cybersecurity response capabilities and
a subsequent reduction in organizational resilience.

## Recommended Countermeasures

A cybersecurity strategy should be developed in parallel with business and IT strategies. [1]
Strategy needs to be set at both organizational and national level and have a socio-technical perspective [2].
