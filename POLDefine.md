# Monitoring Politics

## Capability and Deficits
Monitoring political developments, particularly the geo-political landscape, can give organizations in some countries warning of likely attacks by activists or espionage attempts 
by nation states.

Failure to monitor such developments e.g. through contact with intelligence communities, can leave organizations exposed.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Where organizations beleve they may be targeted by nation states, they should be in active contact with and seeking the advice of intelligence agencies.
