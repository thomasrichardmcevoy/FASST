## Capability and Deficits
Investment in cyber security is necessary to ensure both development and maintenance of the function.  Levels of investment should be set in accordance with quantitative risk 
criteria and a risk appetite established (based on acceptable amounts of loss).

Failure to invest in cybersecurity leads to obvious technical and resource deficits.  However, it also possible to overspend on cybersecurity either by having a poor or non-
existent strategy or by focusing too much on compliance and failing to address investment in risk terms with justified business cases.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Use of a quantitative risk analysis and management methodology such as FAIR helps to ensure that security spending is balanced with regards to security risk.  Developing a
solid security strategy and associated enterprise architecture supports this.
