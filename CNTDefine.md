# Contingency Planning

## Capability and Deficits
Where incident response may fail to contain an incident, the organization may require to move to a fallback position where they can continue to run key parts of the business.
Contingency planning is about ensuring that feasible fallback positions exist for the organization to move to. For example, under a denial of service attack, an organization may 
have a secondary network location it can use.

Failure to make contingency plans exposes the organization to the likelihood that a serious incident could threaten their continued existence.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Contingency planning should be included in risk management planning covering any major risks the organization is exposed, even if mitigations are in place, and all risks the 
organization has accepted. It should include the ability to fall back to a contingency operation (which covers most key services), to continue to run on that basis and the ability to recover from that mode back to full business operations (though the latter can be covered under business continuity and recover BCR instead)
