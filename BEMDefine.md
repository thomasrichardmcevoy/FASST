# Boundary/Entry Point Management

## Capability and Deficits
It is important to manage how the network is accessed by third parties, by customers and by employees working remotely.  Each of these presents its own security challenges and
failure to address them can leave the organization exposed to data theft, fraud or sabotage.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Countermeasures will depend on the circumstances of entry, but in principle, all access should be known and approved, all access should be monitored and all access should be 
controlled.  For example, a customer accessing a web store front should not be able to exploit software vulnerabilities to target the underlying database or to interfere with
the sales flow.  Remote access employees should have their access limited while their systems are checked for malware and of course access should ideally be controlled by
multifactor identification protocols.  Third party suppliers and their staff should have well defined entry points such as extranet functionality and agreed protocols for
approving access.
