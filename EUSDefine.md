# End User Support

## Capability and Deficits
Part of the issue with security technology is that it can be perceived to be difficult to use or cause issues due to a lack of end user support.  

Where end user support is not available, users may look for workarounds to security technology, especially if it appears to be behaving badly.

## Recommended Countermeasures

End user support (Service desk) should be trained in any security technology which is released and be able to deal with common problems or escalate issues as required.
