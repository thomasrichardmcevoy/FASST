## Capability and Deficits
An operating model is an artifact of the enterprise architecture of an organization.  It defines the processes and technology which will be used to detect and respond
to security incidents.  At least the following elements are included in an operating model.  Native sensors and logging mechanisms and/or agents which can detect anomalous
security related events.  The means to record, store and transmit logs, preferably retaining full forensic integrity. The capability to collate and correlate logs centrally (
in a security events monitor) and to interpret this information both electronically and by operators to determine whether systems have been breached or compromised.  In turn, this
includes the ability to triage and respond to those incidents in order of priority.  These capabilities include detection at both server and endpoint level.

The operating model will also log information required to service users and to detect froms of unauthorized access or actions by users, both privileged and non-privileged.

Finally, the operating model should include both threat intelligence and informational metrics which should act as an input to the GRC function of the organization.

Deficits in the operating model appear where there are technical gaps or where human operators do not have the skill, experience or the capacity to interpret the information 
they receive.  In the latter case, the workplace design of the operating centre is frequently implicated.  The primary risk exposure of any failure of the operating model is to 
cyber attacks or unauthorised actions by insiders.

## Recommended Countermeasures

It is difficult for most organizations to fully resource a complete operating model and therefore they should strongly consider outsourcing this aspect of their security to 
specialist third party organizations.
