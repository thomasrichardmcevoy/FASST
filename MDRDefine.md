# Monitoring, Detection and Response

## Capability and Deficits
Part of the operating model, the capability to monitor for potential anomalies and security events, triage and respond appropriately is delivered through a security operations 
centre.

Without the ability to detect cybersecurity incidents or anomalous events which may be indicative of such events, organizations are generally helpless in the face of large
scale events.  They will still have some security capability e.g. tools which have native detection and response such as anti virus software but they will not be able to
organize the kind of response needed to deal with a full scale attack.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Organizations should build or hire security operations centre capabilities.  Even small organizations can benefit from these by basing operations in the cloud where large scale 
suppliers such as Amazon have these capabilities at infrastructure level, reducing their responsibilities to monitoring application security.
