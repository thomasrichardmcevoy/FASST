# Social Influence

## Capability and Deficits

Staff are influenced by colleagues and friends, managers and experts with regards to their security behavior.  If there is an ideal, it should be that managers take decisions, 
experts influence decisions and promote good behaviors and colleagues and friends agree these are socially acceptable and breaching such behaviors is socially unacceptable.

However, other behaviors can occur.  For example, if managers and teams feel abandoned or ignored by experts, they can start to come up with their own "shadow" security 
practices, which may or may not be ideal in security terms.   It can also become socially acceptable to bypass security features where everyone perceives them to be
unhelpful.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Working for the right balance of management decision taking, expert influence and team support is a soft skill.  Many of the other practices in this section contribute along
with good security and awareness training.
