# Accountable Decision Making

## Capability and Deficits
A frequent pattern in security is for decision-makers to block work for security reasons because solutions do not solve all security risks.  The opposite pattern of accepting any 
solution despite the risk can also occur.  

In the first case, opportunity costs accumulate as projects are delayed or even abandoned.  In the second case, projects may produce systems which are not secured against 
known and obvious risks.

## Recommended Countermeasures

The balanced approach is to ensure that decision-making processes and decision-makers are held accountable for decisions, both by their own managers and by allowing
appeals processes against decisions - whether too lax or too strict.
