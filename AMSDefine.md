# Anti-Malware Strategies

## Capability and Deficits

To defeat malware, a broad range of strategies need to be deployed by an organization including the following possible approaches -

- Training and awareness for staff
- Signature based strategies at perimeter, endpoint and network
- Heuristic based strategies at perimeter, endpoint and network
- AI based strategies at perimeter, endpoint and network
- Intrusion detection and/or virtual patching
- Patch and vulnerability management
- Web based intrusion detection
- Cloud based traffic monitoring and analysis
- Secure code development
- Secure configuration deployment

While not all measures need to be deployed, nonetheless failing to deploy a spread of measures opens a gap for malware.

## Recommended Countermeasures

A risk managed approach should be adopted to defeating malware which deploys a range of methods.  A minimum in technical terms is likely to be a mix of at least signature and 
heuristic based approaches with patch and vulnerability management.
