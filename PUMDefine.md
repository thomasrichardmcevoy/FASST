# Monitoring the Public and Press

## Capability and Deficits
Monitoring public opinion e.g on social media and monitoring the press can give early warning of potential threats (such as from activist groups).  It can also make the
company more responsive to client complaints, where relevant, about security issues or fraud (banking provides good examples here).
