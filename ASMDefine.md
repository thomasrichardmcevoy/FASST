# Asset Management

## Capability and Deficits
Asset management is the capability to track assets - which can be variously defined e.g. data, servers, software, human resources.  Generally, in information systems, the primary
focus is hardware and software and in information security the focus is on data.  In fact, both are needed and different systems may be used for each.

Failure to track assets makes it difficult to manage information security requirements.  For example, if a specific patch is needed for a server running a specific generation of 
operating system then without asset management only informal or implicit knowledge of where these servers are exists, making planning the upgrade unfeasible and exposing the 
organization to potential gaps in its coverage.  If data theft is carried out against a data store, not knowing, for example, the number, category or sensitivity of the data 
records makes it more difficult to estimate how much damage has been done or whether a regulator needs to be informed.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Assets are tracked in different ways for different reasons e.g. financial purposes.  These systems may not be compatible with information security requirements.  It is
recommended that asset information be stored in a CMDB in CIs as this is the most useful formation for tracking assets for information systems and information security
management purposes. [Note, some experts would not regard CIs as "assets", but for practical purposes, this is the most useful way of tracking them and their relationships
to one another which is a key part of understanding the impacts of security management decisions or incidents].
