## Capability and Deficits
It is important to invest in human cybersecurity capability, both to recruit teams for risk management, architecture and security operations functions and also to ensure their 
ongoing training and professional development.  For smaller companies, this may be achieved through part time personnel in the different roles, but larger companies should
make a considerable investment in the area and not simply rely third party support.  Investment should also be in IT staff to ensure they are trained and aware of security
requirements

Failure to invest in human cyber security capability undermines the ability of the whole organization to function meaningfully in this area.    It affects risk management,
strategy, architecture, operations and day to day delivery.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Plan what your cyber security team should look like and what capabilities should be grown in house and which can be outsourced to third parties and consultants.  Also ensure
that staff receive ongoing development in cybersecurity which as a rapidly changing field requires individuals to keep up with the latest developments, attacks, tactics and
strategies.
