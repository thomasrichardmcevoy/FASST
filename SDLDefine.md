# Secure Development Lifecycle

## Capability and Deficits
Part of application development, a secure development lifecycle means that security is addressed as part of planning, design, testing, build, operation and deprecation of a system. 
This goes beyond instituting a set of processes to ensure that development staff are training in implementing security functionality and writing secure code.  It also includes
having security champions as part of the project team.  Finally, it includes aspects of functional testing such as static code review, dynamic code review and fuzzy testing.

Failure to incorporate an end to end focus on security during development leads to likely security gaps appearing in the system.

## Recommended Countermeasures
Instituting a secure development lifecycle requires a holistic commitment to addressing security in every part of the development program for an organisation and incorporates
project planning, staff training and awareness, use of security champions and allowing time to test and address security issues during development.  One of the major sources of
flaws in operating software is the failure to address security throughout the lifecycle of a system.
