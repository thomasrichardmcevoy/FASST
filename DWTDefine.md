# Workflow Integration

## Capability and Deficits

This is a key part of control and feedback within an organization.  The data to carry out processes and to report on results needs to be complete and relevant.  For example, 
if a vulnerability scan reveals a set of patches which need to be updated across a set of systems, a process mechanism needs to exist to inform the installation team of the 
requirement to include the new patches in the next installation.

Furthermore, any process or technical mechanisms for coordinating work between two parties to an end goal need to be corresponding.  For example, if an encryption mechanism is 
used to hash data to demonstrate that it hasn't been tampered with, the receiving party needs to include a check of the hash to complete the workflow to ensure data
integrity.

Failure to ensure control and feedback on processes executed across two or more parts of the organization lead to the breakdown of security mechanisms and expose the organization
to multiple potential failures.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Work design needs to be checked by using user and management walkthroughs, which may be supported by formal methods such as the use of STAMP to ensure that control and feedback 
mechanisms are in place and functioning as expected.
