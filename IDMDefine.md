# Identity and Access Management

## Capability and Deficits
Identity and access management is the capability to control not only which individuals and teams have access to a system but also what they are authorized to do on that system.

Most systems tend to suffer from a 'bloat' in user access and user capabilities, particularly for privileged users. They have far more ability to do damage to the 
system because their capabilities are greater than those needed to actually carry out their roles.  This 'bloat' can also aid hackers or malicious code if it manages to acquire access
to privileged functions, tools or accounts.

## Recommended Countermeasures

A tight mapping between roles and responsibilities, jobs and tasks, and associated application, database and operating system capabilities is required to reduce capability and
access 'bloat'.  This should be coupled with regular reviews of users' current roles and steps to remove any users no longer active on the system, e.g. leavers or people on long
term sick.

Some tools can be used to further reduce access e.g. to media or application use.
