# Physical Plant Protection

## Capability and Deficits
Data centres and buildings with network and computer equipment should be protected both against natural disasters and against environmental insults such as fire, water, dust,
power surges or breakdowns and overheating.

While ultimately a breakdown in a data centre can be dealt with by applying appropriate contingency measures, it is important that data centres are resilient against these
kind of events, whether causes accidentally or maliciously, and legal or regulatory penalties are likely to follow if they are not so protected.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Depending on the type of outage, various countermeasures are required e.g. fire prevention measures, but also data centres need to be guarded against physical intrusion where
damage could be done directly to equipment.
