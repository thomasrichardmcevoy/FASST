# Incident Response

## Capability and Deficits
Incident response is the capability to detect, triage and determine the nature of an incident and respond to it with a set of planned countermeasures.

Failure to respond to incidents adequately leads to incidents causing greater damage and possibly spreading in the organization.

## Recommended Countermeasures
Incident response is not simply about being able to detect or prioritise incidents or have good technical responses.  It also requires planning and rehearsing for major types 
of incident e.g. using a cyber range. While no response plan will ever match a real life incident, this kind of experience teaches the incident response team to think on its
feet and adapt to security incidents as they unfold.  In addition, it allows managers to identify times when key decisions might be required from them e.g. to shut off a business 
process or network access.
