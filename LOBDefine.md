# Lobbying

## Capability and Deficits
As well as tracking legislative and regulatory effort, organizations should seek to positively influence legislation and regulation.  This is a parallel process to taking staff
issues with security policy seriously by raising similar, possibly larger, concerns at the legislative or regulatory level where security  measures can lead to overly costly or
excessive requirements which can burden organizations. Obviously, any such efforts need to be backed by solid evidence of acceptable alternatives.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Lobbying either singly or as part of an interest group legislative and regulatory bodies can help organizations and regulators to do security better.
