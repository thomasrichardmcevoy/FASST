# Reward and Discipline Systems

## Capability and Deficits
Unlike in safety systems, the lessons of a just culture have not been absorbed in security culture, so many incidents are diagnosed by a shortsighted search for blame and
can result in disciplinary action or possibly a requirement to retrain the individuals found to be at fault.  This approach does not solve underlying problems in security
in the organization and can act against incidents being reported or investigated properly leading to a long term weakness in the security approach.

## Recommended Countermeasures

A just culture approach should be adopted to incident investigation, with a no blame approach to investigation.  Reporting incidents or near misses should be rewarded rather
than punished unless the person is clearly acting from malice.
