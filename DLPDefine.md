# Data Leakage Protection

## Capability and Deficits
Data leakage protection is a combination of knowing where your data assets are stored and how they are communicated and technical and process controls of who has access to them 
and can communicate them.

Data classification lies at the heart of data leakage protection as a way of determining (based on risk assessment) what assets should be protected e.g. with encryption, during
storage, during movement and also to whom this data should be made available in the organization.  Technology can also be used to enforce communication flows outside of
the organization such as where sensitive data is sent to.

Failure to track data assets and ensure that they are appropriately handled and communicated makes the organization exposed to data theft and/or associated regulatory breaches.

## Recommended Countermeasures
Data assets should be logged and classified and as a minimum procedures defined for their handling and onward transmission.  Ideally, these measures should be enforced by 
technology for highly sensitive assets, e.g. preventing IPR being emailed outside the organization.
