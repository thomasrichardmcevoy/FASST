# Project Management

## Capability and Deficits
Project management is the skill of planning and managing projects and the resources required to achieve their goals.

A deficit in project management planning can lead to project timelines and resourcing being underestimated which can result in project cancellation in some cases. It can
also mean the project goals fail to match with overall program goals leading to a deficit in the security program.  Finally, a mismanaged project can not only run over
time and budget but can in some cases being delayed due to a failure to obtain resources.

The primary security exposures coming from a failure in project management would be a failure to meet with project goals leading to a gap in security coverage or to an audit or 
regulatory breach.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Project managers with skill and experience in security are the best choice to manage cyber security projects. Project managers should also not be afraid to challenge
unfeasible or mismatched project goals on behalf of technical resources employed in the project and work to agree formal changes to aims and delivery dates where necessary 
while sticking within tolerance for budget and quality.
