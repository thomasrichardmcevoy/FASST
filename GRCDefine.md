# Governance, Risk and Compliance

## Capability and Potential Deficits

Governance refers to creating and monitoring adherence to policies devised by the organization and is ultimately the responsiblity of the company board.  Risk refers to cybersecurity risk analysis and management activities. Compliance refers to ensuring that company policies and procedures adhere to local legislation and sector regulation.

Each of these is actually separate areas with their own potential deficits.  A company which fails to set and communicate policy and monitor policy outcomes will lose control of the behavior of its employees and managers and not be able to effectively build company values or culture.  It will also be able to tell when the company drifts into an insecure status.  A company which does not engage in meaningful risk analysis and management activities will not have cost-effective security measures in place and may suffer from security neglect in some areas and overcompensation in others.  A company which fails to enforce compliance to legislation or regulation may be subject to severe penalities - both fines and legal actions - in the case of a breach and, in some cases, simply for not meeting its regulatory obligations.

## Recommended Countermeasures
A strong governance, risk and compliance framework contributes to addressing all of these deficits and also provides a firm foundation for any other security activity the organization undertakes [1].  It also underpins Enterprise Risk Management activities.
