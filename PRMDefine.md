# Program Management

## Capability and Deficits

Program management is the coordination of a set of projects to reach a strategic goal.

A failure to institute program management can result in strategic goals being misinterpreted by individual projects, lack of synergy between projects, conflicts in resources and overlap/duplication of project effort.  These conditions can lead to project failure undermining the overall goals of the program.  For a security program, this increases the likelihood of gaps opening in the security posture.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Institute a structured program of projects under a project management board in support of security goals which exercises oversight over the set of projects and resolves issues related to the interaction of projects and resource and other conflicts, while preventing overlap and duplication of effort [1].
