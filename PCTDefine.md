# Professional and Technical Communication

**Capability**

Professional and technical communication refers to the capability to use all forms of media - verbal, textual and visual - to communicate the technical and business aspects of
security risk to both senior manager and junior staff by technical experts and operational managers.  It also refers to senior manager's capability to communicate policy, vision and goals to the organization and for regulators and legislators both to understand sector needs and formulate policy, legislation and regulation in a comprehensible manner.

**Deficit Risk Factors**

Senior managers may not understand security priorities or what actions are advised and make poorer decisions.  Junior management or staff may misunderstand policy, guidance or procedures and act in error. Mental models of security risk will be deficit (1).  Government and regulatory bodies may communicate policy poorly or be ill-advised on risks and countermeasures.

**Adapted Rassmussen 5 Factor Analysis**

Poor communication affects the characteristics of [control and feedback] and [learning culture] -

1. preventing commands from being executed properly or else 
2. preventing the status of a system being properly understood.
3. creating a barrier to comprehension and learning

**FASST Dependencies**

Poor communication can affect [mental models] of risk.

**Sociotechnical Aspects (COPT)**

Communication styles are part of the culture of the organization.  The values held by senior managers can be affected by successful or unsuccessful communication strategies and
tactics and hence affect power chances for security goals. The processes of the organization can be affected by successful or unsuccessful communication.  In turn, this can impact on technology.  It can also affect government and regulatory bodies and have an impact on legislation, regulation and associated policies.

**Recommended Countermeasures**

Ensure that all technical experts and operational managers achieve certification in professional and technical communication for engineers.  Senior managers should employ professional communications experts as part of their messaging strategy, both internally and externally. Legislators and regulators should similarly employ professional communicators such as technical writers.
