# Professional and Technical Communication

**Capability**

Professional and technical communication refers to the capability to use all forms of media - verbal, textual and visual - to communicate the technical and business aspects of
security risk to both senior manager and junior staff by technical experts and operational managers.

**Deficit Risk**

Where this capability is lacking, senior managers may not understand security priorities or what actions are advised and make ill-advised decisions.  Junior staff may misunderstand policy, guidance or procedures and act in error.

**Sociotechnical Aspects (COPT)**

Communication styles are part of the culture of the organization.  The values held by senior managers can be affected by successful or unsuccessful communication strategies and
tactics and hence affect power chances for security goals. The processes of the organization can be affected by successful or unsuccessful communication.  In turn, this can impact on technology.
