# Professional and Technical Communication

## Capability and Deficits

Professional and technical communication refers to the capability to use all forms of media - verbal, textual and visual - to communicate the technical and business aspects of
security risk with both senior manager and junior staff by technical experts and operational managers.  

As a result of poor communication, senior managers may not understand security priorities or what actions are advised and make poorer decisions.  Junior management or staff may misunderstand policy, guidance or procedures and act in error.  They may also fail to coordinate actions. [1]. 

Hence good communication skills, particularly at the middle management layer, underpin its cybersecurity posture and ability to deal with a changing risk environment.
