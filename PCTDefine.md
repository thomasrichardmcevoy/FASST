# Professional and Technical Communication

## Capability

Professional and technical communication refers to the capability to use all forms of media - verbal, textual and visual - to communicate the technical and business aspects of
security risk wtih both senior manager and junior staff by technical experts and operational managers.  

To some extent, it also refers to senior manager's capability to communicate policy, vision and goals to the organization. to regulators and legislators both to understand sector needs and formulate policy, legislation and regulation in a comprehensible manner and for junior staff to communicate with each other.

## Deficits

Poor communication affects the characteristics of control and feedback and learning culture -

1. preventing commands from being executed properly or else 
2. preventing the status of a system being properly understood.
3. creating a barrier to comprehension and learning

As a result, senior managers may not understand security priorities or what actions are advised and make poorer decisions.  Junior management or staff may misunderstand policy, guidance or procedures and act in error.  They may also fail to coordinate actions. Government and regulatory bodies may communicate policy poorly or be ill-advised on risks and countermeasures [1].

## Recommended Countermeasures

Ensure that all technical experts and operational managers achieve certification in professional and technical communication for engineers.  Senior managers should employ professional communications experts as part of their messaging strategy, both internally and externally. Legislators and regulators should similarly employ professional communicators such as technical writers.  Junior staff should receive some basic training in clear communication techniques, particularly verbal communication.
