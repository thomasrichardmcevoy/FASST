# Handling Conflict

## Capability and Deficits
Where security procedures or functionality cause conflict, it is quite common to see experts and/or managers overrule users and ignore where such procedures or technology is 
causing problems with workload and lead to cost overspend at lower levels of the organization.  

This behavior of not handling but suppressing conflict can lead to teams choosing to bypass security arrangements and engage in "shadow" security work.  Similar situations
also arise where demands for new applications which could cut workload are ignored.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Management should take conflict seriously and work for a joint resolution rather than simply overruling objections to security policy, planning, procedures or technology.
