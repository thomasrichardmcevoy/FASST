# User Acceptance Testing

## Capability and Deficits
It is important that security technology and features with implications for user actions are not imposed with user acceptance testing.  Many security features are guilty of 
poor design leading to users being overburdened or confused and less likely to use the security feature or to avoid using it or to successfully plead with their managers to
have it switched off in their case.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Security features which do not pass user acceptance should not be incorporated into organizations systems.  Better security designs should be sought.
