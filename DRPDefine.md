# Disaster Recovery

## Capability and Deficits
Disaster recovery forms part of contingency planning.  It represents a specific set of fallback operational models which the organization can use for specific disaster scenarios. 
Usually, there is no one to one match between a real life scenario and a planned one, but it is possible to build a DR plan out of the set of possible responses.

Without DR planning, security incidents would take their full toll on organisation's business. DR planning reduces the impact of any serious security incident.

## Recommended Countermeasures
Contingency planning should include have a set of regularly tested or walked through DR scenarios that system administrators and managers know the organization is capable of drawing on.
