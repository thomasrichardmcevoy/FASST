# Attitude To Risk

## Capability and Deficits
Risk attitudes should ideally be balanced - neither too lax, nor too paranoid - but this is strongly influenced by the business context.  For example, a critical infrastructure 
organization with a strong emphasis on health and safety is likely to carry this attitude over to security and be conservative and strongly compliant, while, on the other hand,
a business startup is likely to be more willing to take risks to achieve business goals.

Too risk averse and an organization risks paralyzing itself through inaction or by overexpenditure on security requirements leading to lost opportunity-costs.  Too lax an attitude
can lead to an organization exposing itself to losses which it cannot bear, leading to business collapse.

## Recommended Countermeasures
Use of techniques like FAIR help an organization to determine whether its risk attitude is reasonable and what level of losses it can bear as well as the worth of making
various security investments.
