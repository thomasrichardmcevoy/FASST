# Enterprise Sscurity Architecture

## Capability and Deficits

An enterprise architecture (EA) is a conceptual blueprint that defines the structure and operation of organizations. The intent of enterprise architecture is to determine how an organization can effectively achieve its current and future objectives. Enterprise architecture involves the practice of analyzing, planning, designing and eventual implementing of analysis on an enterprise. 

Enterprise security architecture is a subset of the enterprise architecture and represents the design of how cybersecurity will be incorporated in the organization's structure, processes and technology at high level.

Without a conceptual blueprint of how the organization will function, any changes to security in the organization will be driven by short term tactical requirements and will lack structure and may be incompatible with overall goals. Breakdowns in communication and coordination between different parts of the organization are likely to occur.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Enterprise security architecture should be undertaken as a serious discipline in the organization touching on its organizational structure, its workflows, operating models and technological investment.  It represents a strongly socio-technical element in the design of how businesses should operate securely [1].  Many, if not all the other factors, in this framework are impacted by the Enterprise Security Architecture of an organization [1].
