# Work Organization

## Capability and Deficits

Work organization and design can support or undermine security.  For example, if a job requires tracking multiple passwords but no facilities are given to do so, then inevitably
staff will find a workaround which involves writing down passwords in some way or otherwise breaching password policy. 

Another example is  in secure operating centres where first line staff are given little or no career development opportunities or the chance to see what happens to issues they
detect.  This results in poor staff morale and high turnover.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Work organisation and design should be taken account of in designing and testing security procedures and technology.  Enterprise security architecture should address organizational issues.
