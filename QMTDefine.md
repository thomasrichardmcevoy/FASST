# Quality Management

## Capability and Deficits

Quality management is a discipline where each stage of production creation is checked to ensure it meets production quality goals before proceeding to the next stage. For
example, before a server is released into production, it should be checked to ensure that all known patches and vulnerabilities have been addressed, its configuration is
correct and any security or set up tools have been removed from the operating system or otherwise disabled.

A failure to apply quality management principles to build environments leads to security vulnerabilities including incidental granting of administrative privileges.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Penetration testing or vulnerability scanning can be used to detect build errors.  In addition, build scripts should contain steps to ensure correct configuration with
check points.
