# Quality Management

## Capability and Deficits

Quality management is a discipline where each stage of production creation is checked to ensure it meets production quality goals before proceeding to the next stage. For
example, before a server is released into production, it should be checked to ensure that all known patches and vulnerabilities have been addressed, its configuration is
correct and any security or set up tools have been removed from the operating system or otherwise disabled. 

Quality management applies to other parts of the IT environment, including building, environmental controls, fire and flood control and power supply.

## Recommended Countermeasures

Quality management requires planning testing and checks at each stage of the system build.  To counter cyber attacks, a particular attention needs to be paid to build and release scripts and running vulnerability scans of builds to check configurations.  This may need careful planning as requirements for a stable environment may contradict requirements to manage vulnerabilities.
